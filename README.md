playlists.py
transfer your Google Play Music playlists to Spotify

This python script reads your own google music playlists (but no playlists shared
with you) and creates the same(as far as possible) playlists on spotify.
It needs gmusicapi and spotipy, install both with pip[3].

ENTER YOUR ACCOUNT DATA AT THE START OF TH SCRIPT!

If you're using Google's 2 factor authentication, create an app-specific password
on https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords

On first run, you must allow the spotify access by opening a web site in your
browser (URL is printed by the script) and copying the URL you're redirected
to the command line.
